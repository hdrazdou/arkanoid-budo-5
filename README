Arkanoid Game I made on Unity training course.

Link to play:

What I've done:
- Moving Platform (by Mouse input)
- Jumping Ball (RigidBody and Collider)
- Moving Ball synchronously with Platform
- Blocks (to be broken by Ball hits)
- Different states (Sprites) when Blocks are being broken
- Changing Level (Scene) when all Blocks are broken
- Scoring feature (different score for different Blocks)
- HP feature (Hearts sprites) 
- Game Pause (by esc)
- Game Over screen with Restart button
- Game Won screen with Restart button
- Trail for the Ball
- PickUps feature (Bonus) when Blocks are broken:
1. Changing Block size
2. Changing Platform size
3. Changing Ball speed
4. Changing User's HP and Score 
5. Cloning active Ball(s)
6. Ball sticking to the Platform
7. Ball exploding on collision
- Sound when PickUp is catched
- SFX and VFX for explosion (Ball or Block)

What I've used:
- Prefabs for GameObjects
- Game Services to manage the features (GameService, LevelService, PickUpService, PauseService, AudioService)
- NameSpacing in Code
- ScriptableObject (as config for Blocks states)
- Singleton pattern (for saving GameObjects between scenes)
- Prototype pattern (for cloning the Ball)
- Dynamic Instantiate of GameObjects
- DontDestroyOnLoad method
- AudioSource component for SFX of PickUps


What I've learned:
- Familiarize with Unity lifecycle (Awake, Start, OnDestroy...)
- Familiarize with Unity 2D physics
- Collisions and Colliders (also OverlapCircleAll)
- Using GitHub/Fork
