Arkanoid Game I made on Unity training course.

Link to play:

What I've done:
- Moving Platform (by Mouse input)
- Jumping Ball (RigidBody and Collider)
- Moving Ball synchronously with Platform
- Blocks (to be broken by Ball hits)
- Different states (Sprites) when Blocks are being broken
- Changing Level (Scene) when all Blocks are broken
- Scoring feature (different score for different Blocks)
- HP feature (Hearts sprites) 
- Game Pause (by esc)
- Game Over screen with Restart button
- Trail for the Ball
- PickUps feature (Bonus) when Blocks are broken:
1. Changing Block size
2. Changing Platform size
3. Changing Ball speed
4. Changing User's HP and Score 
5. Cloning active Ball(s)
6. Ball sticking to the Platform

What I've used:
- Prefabs for GameObjects
- Game Services to manage the features (GameService, LevelService, PickUpService, PauseService)
- NameSpacing in Code
- ScriptableObject (as config for Blocks states)
- Singleton pattern (for saving GameObjects between scenes)
- Prototype pattern (for cloning the Ball)
- Dynamic Instantiate of GameObjects
- DontDestroyOnLoad method

What I've learned:
- Familiarize with Unity lifecycle (Awake, Start, OnDestroy...)
- Familiarize with Unity 2D physics
- Collisions and Colliders (also OverlapCircleAll)
- Using GitHub/Fork
